# Steam-Level-Changer

This "Steam Level Changer" script modifies the Steam Profile interface to allow users to visually adjust their displayed Steam level on their profile page using a custom menu activated with a right-click. It does not actually change their Steam level permanently, only how it appears on the page. (UI ONLY)
